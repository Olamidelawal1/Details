            <em>I'm a lover of technology because i believe so much has been achieved with the aid of technology and there's 
            still more milstones to cover. Technology has definitely helped to improve the quality of life people live
            and it has also helped to improve the chances of survival of imdividual's diagnosed with certain medical 
            conditions.</em>

            <p>Since joining the <strong>Stutren Graduate Accelerator Program,</strong> I have learnt a lot about programming 
            languages like <em>HTML and CSS.</em> For instance, i realised that CSS is used in beautifyoing web pages 
            such that it brings color and life to the web pages beimg designed.

            <p>The difference that exists between <strong>paddings, margins and borders</strong> 
                is that a margin is the space around an element's boder,<em>while</em> padding is the space between
                an element's border and the element's content <em>and</em> the border is usually the perimeter of the box.
